This app was developed to impove my code knowledge. It may not cover all management tools to run an adventure club.

This app has the follow features:

*  Multiple users access profile (under development)

  Some features are only avaliable for an specific user profile.
  Five diferents profiles were set. They are:
  - admin (full access);
  - manager (access to finantial module, election module, sports module and travelling module);
  - sport (access to sports module);
  - finantial (access to finantial module);
  - member (access to his own profile, to vote and subscribe for a ticket at election module, to pay at finantial module, to subscribe for a trip at travelling module and to manager, sport and finantial reports[only read]);

* Finantial module (not started yet)

  In this module, the members will be able to send their payment voucher to the treasurer and the managers will control all the budget (easier then before).
  The manager and finantial profiles will be able to generate the annual finantial report to show at the general meeting.

* Sports module (not started yet)

  In this module, the technical directors will control the athletes (members) performance in all sports related to the club.
  The manager and sport profiles will be able to generate the annual sport performance report to show at the general meeting.

* Election module (not started yet)

  In this module, the manager will set all election process.
  The members will be able to resgister a ticket to run for the management council and to vote remotely.

* Travelling module (not started yet)

  In this module, the manager profile can schedule a trip for all members.
  The members can subscribe for the club trip.
  If the trip has less vacancies than subscribers, the manager profile can do an eletronic draf for the available vacancies.
